Stephanie is originally from the suburbs of Denver, Colorado.  She attended University of Colorado (Go Buffs) and later NYU.  She currently works at Charles Schwab and moved to San Francisco in 2012.<br><br>
Josh is originally from a small island across the water from Seattle, where he grew up before attending the University of Washington (Go Dawgs!).  Since graduating UW he has worked at KPMG, first in Seattle and more recently in San Francisco where he moved in 2010.  He travels frequently for work, and when not on the road can generally be found either cycling or skiing with Stephanie and friends.

Josh and Stephanie met in San Francisco in the fall of 2012 through a group of mutual friends - all of whom have claimed responsibility in their own right.  While it&rsquo;s difficult to say who is truly to thank for the introduction, there is no question that night would never have been the same without the presence of PBR and late night street food.

Josh proposed on September 13, 2014 in Laguna Nigel, California overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  His originally planned proposal in Lake Tahoe was interrupted due to business travel, and Josh was left with the task of re-planning the proposal in southern California on short notice.  With the help of a friend who broke into their apartment, Stephanie who unwittingly carried her own ring on the flight down, and some very helpful travel agents - he managed to reconstruct his plans in less than 48 hours.  Stephanie said yes, and the rest - as they say - is history.
